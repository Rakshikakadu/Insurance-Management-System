# Insurance-Management-System

## About

The project is a Spring Boot-based RESTful API for an insurance management system. It uses Spring Data JPA for persistence and an embedded database for development purposes.

The system has three main domain models: Client, InsurancePolicy, and Claim. A Client represents a person who has one or more insurance policies, and an InsurancePolicy represents the coverage details of an insurance policy, including its associated client. A Claim represents an insurance claim made by a client against one of their policies.
